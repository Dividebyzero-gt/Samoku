For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use **serverless edge functions** for all API routes and logic — including authentication, product CRUD, order processing, and dropshipping API calls.

- Host functions on edge runtimes (Supabase Edge Functions).
- Ensure fast cold starts and low latency, especially for global traffic.
- Functions should be stateless and connect securely to the Supabase/PostgreSQL database via serverless-safe client.
- API endpoints should reside in the `/api` folder and export handlers compatible with edge runtimes.
- Use native Web APIs or lightweight libraries (e.g., `undici`, `cross-fetch`) in edge handlers.
- Avoid usage of Node.js-only packages that are incompatible with edge environments.

ensure when creatin new pages there are not duplicate, to avoid editing confusion in pages
remove all mock data and create real implementation, for our project


⚠️ Do not use any mock data, placeholder APIs, or simulated logic. All code should use real implementations with production-ready logic, connected to the actual database, edge functions, or third-party APIs (e.g., dropshipping API, Stripe, Supabase).

Do not include fake products, mock vendors, or dummy users.
All database models, API routes, and UI components must reflect real-world usage with actual data fetching, mutations, and validations.
Use Supabase/PostgreSQL for persistent storage, not local state or JSON arrays.
For any third-party API (e.g., dropshipping), integrate real endpoints using secure fetch methods — no stubs or sample responses.
If an API key or credential is required, request for it and add to supabase
If real data isn't available yet, build the code as if data will come from the live source — do not generate filler content or simulate responses.
